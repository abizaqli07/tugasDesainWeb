    <h1>PTIK FKIP UNS</h1>
    <p>
        The <span class="turn">Faculty of Teacher Training and Education</span>, <span class="turn">Sebelas Maret University</span>, Surakarta 
        is an <span class="turn">Educational Personnel Education Institution (LPTK)</span> which has 24 study 
        programs in 6 majors. Each study program has its own characteristics in producing 
        <span class="turn">superior, strong and intelligent educational staff</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <span class="turn">Informatics and Computer Technology Education (PTIK)</span> study program is planned 
        to take shelter in the management of the <span class="turn">Engineering and Vocational Education 
        (PTK)</span> department. This placement revises our previous statement, where the PTIK 
        study program is under the P.MIPA department. PTIK is a study program that will 
        produce graduates who are <span class="turn">prioritized to teach in vocational/vocational programs</span>. 
        So, it would be better if PTIK was under the PTK department which oversees 
        vocational programs such as <span class="turn">Building Engineering Education</span>, and <span class="turn">Mechanical 
        Engineering Education</span>. To meet the needs of lecturers in the field of information 
        technology that cannot be met by the PTK department, PTIK will conduct <span class="turn">resource 
        sharing with the mathematics study program</span>.
